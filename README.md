Hello guys/gals,
This project having started to code Android with Java for learning. So i did.
In this project you will see four math operation (+-*/),
This calculators numbers limitted with 15 character (if you want you can change later, i think enough),
You can enter float number for operations,
This calculator can show results with 6 decimal place,
Also i added error message for against zeroDivideError, so if you see the message you will change the number :),
